\subsection{Proposed Systems}
Our Deepfake Detection System is an online tool designed to help people identify and deal with deepfake content. It focuses on providing strong detection capabilities for deepfakes. Users can use the system to analyze and detect potential deepfakes by submitting images. The system uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to accurately identify manipulated or fake media. This helps users recognize and address the risks that come with deepfakes, such as spreading false information, committing fraud, or violating privacy. The deepfake detection system aims to empower users by giving them the tools they need to protect themselves and others from the harmful effects of encountering deepfakes. With the help of cutting-edge algorithms, the system assists users in detecting and raising awareness about deepfakes, making the digital world a safer and more informed place.
