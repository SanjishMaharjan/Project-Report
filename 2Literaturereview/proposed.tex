\subsection{Proposed Systems}
Our proposed Deepfake Detection System is an online application created to aid users in identifying and mitigating the existence of deepfake content. It prioritizes offering robust deepfake detection capabilities to users. Users can take advantage of the system's deepfake detection tools, which enable them to submit images for analysis and detection of potential deepfake content. The system employs advanced algorithms and machine learning methods to accurately identify manipulated or artificially generated media. This assists users in recognizing and addressing the risks associated with deepfake content, such as spreading misinformation, perpetrating fraud, or violating privacy. The deepfake detection system strives to empower users by equipping them with the necessary resources to actively safeguard themselves and others against the potential negative consequences of encountering deepfakes. By leveraging cutting-edge algorithms, the system aids users in detecting and raising awareness about the presence of deepfakes, fostering a safer and more knowledgeable digital environment.
