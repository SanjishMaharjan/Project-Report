Deepfakes, the convincingly realistic  media generated by deep learning algorithms, pose a growing threat to digital integrity and human rights. This project addresses the need for a robust deepfake detection system, particularly in legal contexts where misinformation can impact outcomes and compromise the reliability of digital information. By leveraging the Vision Transformer Model with its attention-based mechanism, our work aims to enhance the accuracy of deepfake detection. Our model's unique attributes enables to capture intricate patterns in AI-generated images, providing a more understanding of potential manipulations. In summary, this project represents a significant advancement in deep learning and digital forensics, delivering a classifier capable of distinguishing between authentic and manipulated media. The outcomes of our research hrlps in implications for identity protection, legal proceedings, and combating the challenges presented by the widespread unregulated usage of deepfake content in the digital landscape.\\
