% \section{LIMITATIONS}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Deepfake detection projects face challenges due to rapidly evolving techniques and the need for diverse training data.
%     \item Adversarial attacks can exploit weaknesses in detection algorithms, making deepfakes harder to identify accurately.
%     \item Deepfake detection algorithms often require significant computational resources, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices.
