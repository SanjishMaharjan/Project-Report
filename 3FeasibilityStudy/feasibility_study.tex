\subsection{Economic feasibility}
This is a low-budget project with no development costs. The total expenditure of the
project is just computational power. The dataset and computational power required for
the project are easily available. The computational power is easily provided by google
collab. So, the project is economically feasible. The system will be simple to
comprehend and use. As a result, there will be no need of trained personnel to use the
system. This system will have the capacity to expand by adding more components.

\subsection{Operational feasibility}
The project is operationally feasible since after the completion of the project, it can be
operated as intended by the user to solve the problems for what it has been developed.

\subsection{Technical feasibility}
The purpose of technical feasibility is to establish whether the project is possible in
terms of software, hardware, manpower, and knowledge to complete. It will take into
account determining resources in support of the suggested scheme. The system is
platform independent because it is written in Python. Advanced machine learning
libraries are available and the technology is cutting-edge. As a result, the system is
technically possible.
