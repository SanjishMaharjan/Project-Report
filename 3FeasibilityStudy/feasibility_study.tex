\subsection{Economic feasibility}
This is a low-budget project with no development costs. The total expenditure of the
project is just computational power. The dataset and computational power required for
the project ware readily available. The computational power was provided by google
collab. So, the project was economically feasible. The system will be simple to
comprehend and use. As a result, there will be no need of trained personnel to use the
system. This system have the capacity to expand by adding more components.

\subsection{Operational feasibility}
The project is operationally feasible, as from  completion of the project, the operation can be carried put for the intended purpose.

\subsection{Technical feasibility}
Our project's technical feasibility is assured by user-friendly tools like React Native, Keras and Google Colab. Keras simplified the implementation of our model, while Google Colab provides a collaborative and accessible environment for efficient development and training.
