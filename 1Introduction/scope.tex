\subsection{Scope}
Our deepfake detection project aims to provide a web-based platform for users to upload videos and classify them as either fake or real. The platform will serve as a valuable tool in preventing the proliferation of deepfakes on the internet. Additionally, we envision the potential to scale up the project by developing a browser plugin for automatic deepfake detection. This would enable seamless integration with popular applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook, allowing users to detect deepfakes before sharing them with others.
The system will support video uploads of varying sizes, ranging from small video clips to larger files. The exact size limit will depend on the implementation and infrastructure constraints. However, efforts will be made to accommodate a wide range of video sizes to ensure user convenience.
