\subsection{Scope}
At present time there are numerous tools available for creating false videos in the current deepfake technology landscape, but there are few trustworthy tools available for spotting them. The idea creation of a deepfake detection software to solve this variance and stop the widespread dissemination of deepfakes is what our project is based upon. Users will be able to post images through our platform and segregate them as authentic or deepfake. This project can also be developed to include the development of a plugin for browsers that will automatically detect deep fakes. Notably, our idea can me implemented on different social sites as well as in various various governmental organizations. A synopsis of the program with the size of the input, bounds on the input, input validation, input dependency, the i/o state diagram, and the major inputs and outputs are explained in this report.
