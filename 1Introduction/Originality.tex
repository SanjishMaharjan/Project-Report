\subsection{Originality of Project}
Our project has been integrated by combining our proprietary datasets with external ones, creating a local environment efficient foundation. We integrate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, for the detection and recognition as we have fine-tuned with carefully selected and required parameters, enhancing our system's accuracy. This unique blend of datasets and ViT integration positions our project ensures efficiency and originality.\\
