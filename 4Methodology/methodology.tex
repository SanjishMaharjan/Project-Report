\subsection{System Development Tools}
Our static Deepfake detection System requires Python, OpenCV,
Machine Learning which are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Python: modules like NumPy, Keras and matplotlib are utilized.
    \item Google Colab
    \item OpenCV
    \item React Native
    \item Expo Library
    \item Git/GitHub
    \item FastAPI
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirement}
The functional requirements of the system are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Authentication of users.
    \item User-friendly interface for uploading and detection.
    \item Image preprocessing.
    \item Mathematical Modeling and Implication. 
    \item Model Development and training.
    \item Testing and Validation.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non Functional Requirement}

These requirements are not needed by the system but are essential for the better
performance of software. The points below focus on the non-functional requirement of
the system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reliability
    \item   Usability
    \item   Security
    \item   Portability
    \item   Speed and responsiveness
    \item  Performance
\end{itemize}
