\subsection{Benefits of Vision Transformer}

The Vision TransformerS (ViT) model has several advantages over many other previous architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Vision Transformer (ViT) analyzes complete images, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the global context. This is essential for detecting intricate patterns associated with deepfake manipulation.
    
    \item It demonstrates efficiency by requiring fewer parameters than traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), optimizing memory utilization and training time.
    
    \item The attention mechanisms in ViT focuses on relevant image regions, enhancing precision in identifying subtle parameters of deepfake manipulation.
    
    \item ViT seamlessly adapts to varied input resolutions, providing flexibility and scalability for effective deepfake detection across diverse datasets.
    
    \item Vision Transformers process image patches independently, reducing sensitivity to absolute position and increasing robustness against translation and rotation.
    
    \item Originally designed for image classification, Vision Transformers display adaptability to diverse modals, proving advantageous for multi-modal deepfake detection cases.
    
\end{itemize}
